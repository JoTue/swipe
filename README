SWIPE version 2 incorporates a number of new features compared to the initial
release, most notably hit statistics, alignments, as well as support for
nucleotide sequences, large databases and MPI.

The software is available from http://dna.uio.no/swipe/

SWIPE is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.
See the file COPYING for details. SWIPE includes some public domain code for
computing alignment statistics extracted from the BLAST software by the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Most features and options are similar and compatible with NCBI BLAST.

Note that, currently, SWIPE does not employ composition based statistics, but
uses the standard Karin-Altschul statistics. Also, sequence filtering of low
complexity regions is not implemented.

Defaults are indicated in parentheses in the option list above.

The BLOSUM45, BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62, BLOSUM80, BLOSUM90, PAM30, PAM70 and PAM250
matrices are "built-in". Other matrices may be specified with a file name.

The query and database sequence type is specified with the "-p" option using
either a numeric or text argument according to the table below:

Numeric String  Query  Database Comparisons
0       blastn  NT     NT       Direct + reverse complementary
1       blastp  AA     AA       Direct
2       blastx  NT     AA       Translated query (6 frames)
3       tblastn AA     NT       Translated database (6 frames)
4       tblastx NT     NT       Translated query and database (6x6 frames)

A plain text file with a list of taxid numbers, one per line, may be specified
with the "-x" option to search only sequences from the specified organisms.
